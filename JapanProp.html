                <b>Background</b>
                <br>

                  This project here is a special one, the map above is a visualization of the day camp I've spent my summers at since 2016.
                  The reason I made the map was because I was invited to one of my camper's Bat Mitzvah's in 2022, and I wanted to present a gift
                  I believed they would cherish more than the average gift shop present.

                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Description</b>
                <br>
                  The map above presented a challenge I have not yet faced in my Cartography career, in that there was no shapefiles or datasets that existed prior for me to
                  use as a foundation. The only option I had were aerial drone photographs the camp took for marketing purposes, as well as raw google satellite imagery.
                  With this as a baselayer, I then had to trace a rough 1:1 layer over these images to create the rough draft of what you see above. This step was then followed by the trimming of
                  any unnecessary elements and the distortion of others, both with the purpose of increasing aesthetic over absolute accuracy. The last step in the process was to create or find svg elements
                  online to represent some of the camp's several activities.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The final form this map was delivered in was a wood-based and laser-engraved map, a form I personally do not have the skills or materials to create on my own.
                  This forced me to use my professional network of colleagues to find an appropriate artisan to outsource the project to, ultimately connecting me to
                  a small business in Ukraine that specialized in wood-based art. In the end, I could not have asked for a better or more beautiful end product.

                 For this project I was tasked with creating my very first thematic maps, in this case a choropleth map. We were
                  given the freedom to select any country and dataset of our choosing, so long as there were more than 15 enumeration units.

                  With the creative freedom given, I chose to map a subject I've only heard in passing before the project which was the supposed
                  rapid aging of Japan. Since Japan is a place I would one day like to work in, understanding the potential economic and political
                  impacts of an aging populace is of vast importance. This subject is also something American and European officials should take note of
                  considering they are forecasted to face a similar issue in the future.
